Original story- Kikuyu folklore
1
Warũhiti nĩarĩ mayũ na nĩonekaga ta arĩ mũthaka. Ona
nĩonekaga e kĩyo. Nĩ kũrĩ andũ moigaga atĩ ti mũnyaka
arĩ, nĩ kĩyo gĩake kĩmũteithagia. Thĩna mũnene wa
Warũhiti warĩ gũkoroka.
Hyena used to be strong and looked beautiful. He used
to look hardworking. There were some people who
would say, 'Hyena is not lucky, he's just hardworking.'
Hyena's main problem was greed.
2
Mũthenya ũmwe nĩ okĩrire akĩĩnogora o kahinda.
Akĩrora riũa rĩkĩratha na agĩkena. Akĩruta rũrĩmĩ rwake
nja na akĩanjia gũtũũha akĩhemahemaga. Aarĩ mũndũ
mũkenu ma.
One day he woke up and stretched himself for a while.
He looked at the rising sun and he was happy. He let
his tongue out as he gamboled around the compound.
He was panting and indeed very happy.
3
No kũrĩ oũguo nĩ akĩigwire emũhũtu tondũ ndakĩrĩte
iria cia rũcinĩ. Ũguo nĩ gũkiuga ndegagũrĩte.
Agĩkĩrũgama akĩoya mũningũ igũrũ. Akĩnuhanuha
maita maigana ona. Akĩigwa kamũcingũ!
All the same he felt hungry. He had not eaten the
morning meal. I mean he had not taken breakfast. He
sniffed the air several times. He smelled an aroma!
4
Akiuga, ‘Ngai wĩ mwega na wĩ mũtana! Nĩ wahe irio
ciakwa cia ũmũthĩ.'
Agĩthuathua otaũrĩa hiti ithuathuaga igĩthiĩ handũ.
Agĩthiĩ ohandũ haraihu oyete mũningũ na igũrũ. No
aiguaga mũcingũ mwega wa nyama cia njino.
He said, 'God you're good and kind. You have given me
my meal for today.'
He limped the way hyenas limp when walking. He
walked for some distance with his snout up. He could
smell the nice aroma of roast meat.
5
Nĩakinyire handũ bara ciahũkanĩte. Ĩmwe yarorete
mwena wa itherero na ĩrĩa ĩngĩ mwena wa rũgũrũ.
Hĩndĩ ĩo mata maitĩkaga kuuma kanua gake ta rũũĩ rwa
Thagana. Akĩoya mũningũ igũrũ amenye ekuoya njĩra
ĩrĩkũ.
He reached a forked road. One fork went to the north,
and the other to the south.That time saliva was
flowing from his mouth like River Sagana. He raised his
snout higher to know which fork to use.
6
Ngũthiĩ na rũgũrũ!’ Agĩcũacũa arorete narũgũrũ. Ona
nĩ akinyire handũ akĩanjia gũtengera akarĩe nyama
naihenya.No nĩakinyire handũ akĩigua, ‘Ai! Ndĩ na ma
no ngereire njĩra ĩrĩa yo?’ Ngoro yake ĩkĩmwĩra, ‘Acha
mũriũ, nĩ ũrire.’
Akĩhũgũka agĩcoka na kũrĩa oimĩte.
'I'll walk to the north!' He walked hurriedly to the
north. He even started running so that he could reach
the meat faster. But he reached a point and asked
himself, 'Am I sure I'm on the right path?' His heart
told him,' No, son you're lost.' He turned and ran back.
7
Agĩkinya macamanĩrio-inĩ ma njĩra orĩngĩ. Agĩtema
ihenya arorete na itherero. Mata no gũtherera
mathereraga. Ona mwĩrĩ wake waihũrĩte thigino nĩ
gũtengera.
Mũningũ awoyete hakuhĩ ũkinyĩre matu.
He came to the crossroads again. He started running
to the south. His saliva was flowing. He was covered in
sweat. His snout was almost reaching the sky.
8
Agĩgĩtengera! Agĩthiĩ! Nyingĩ agĩgĩkinya ohandũ hangĩ
akĩigua aca! Mũcingũ nĩwanyiha. Akĩũria na ngoro, ‘Kaĩ
kũrathiĩ atĩa? Ngai nĩkĩĩ ũrathakĩra ũũ?’
'Haithuru reke ngĩcooke oũrĩa ndoka.' Akĩoya magũrũ
arorete na macamanĩrio rĩngĩ.
He ran! He moved! Again he reached another point
and felt no! The aroma was fading. He asked himself,
'What is going on? God, why are you playing around
with me? All the same let me go back.'
He went back to the crossroads.
9
Nĩakinyire macamanĩrio rĩngĩ. Agĩkĩgama arorete na
rũgũrũ. Mũningũ warorete oigũrũ rĩngĩ. No athiathia
rĩngĩ akĩigua mũcingũ nĩ wanyihanyiha rĩngĩ.
Akĩrũgama. Akiuga, ‘Nyama mwende kana mũrege no
ndĩmũrĩa.’ Akĩhũgũka agĩcooka rĩngĩ.
He reached the crossroad again. He turned to the
north. His snout was raised. After a while, the aroma
became weaker. He stopped. He said, 'Meat, like it or
not, I'll eat you.' He turned and walked back.
10
Akinya macamanĩrio rĩngĩ akĩrũgama. Akiuga, ‘Nyama
mũtinjũĩ inyuĩ.'
Agĩthiĩ na mbere akiuga, ‘Ũmũthĩ nĩ mũkũmenya
Warũhiti nũ.’
Agĩtagania magũrũ make. Meerĩ makĩrora na itherero,
na meerĩ makĩrora na rũgũrũ.
At the crossroad he stopped and said, 'Meat, you don't
know me.' 
He went on, 'Today you'll know who Hyena is.'
He spread his legs. Two of them faced north, and the
other two, south.
11
Akĩoya mũningũ naigũrũ. Akĩanjia rũgendo. Agĩtamba.
Agĩthiĩ. Magũrũ no maratagana. Magĩthiĩ na mbere
gũtagana. Akĩanjia kũigua ruo. Akĩra mwĩrĩ, ‘Horera
mwĩrĩ wakwa. Nyama cia njino nĩ igwetereire.’
His snout went up again. He started on his journey. He
padded. He moved. The legs were spreading wider.
And wider. He started feeling pain. He told his body,
'Calm down my body. Roast meat awaits you.'
12
Warũhiti nĩagĩthire na mbere oũguo. Mwĩrĩ na magũrũ
itiaguanaga. Mwĩrĩ nĩ weraga magũrũ matige wana. No
nako kanua gakera magũrũ nyama cia njino imetereire
oothe.
Hyena went on like that. The body and the legs could
not agree. The body was telling the legs not to be
childish. But the mouth was telling the legs about
roast meat. The meat was waiting for them all.
13
O ũrĩa njĩra ciaraihanagĩrĩria noguo magũrũ
mataganũkaga. Na nĩ hagĩkinyire handũ magũrũ
matangĩataganũkire rĩngĩ.
The legs were spreading wider and wider as the
forkroads spread. There came a time  when the legs
could not spread wider.
14
Warũhiti aiguire mwĩrĩ wake wataganũka kwa!
Agĩtinĩka rwere rũmwe rũkĩrora na itherero. Rũrĩa
rũngĩ rũkĩrora na rũgũrũ.
Warũhiti agĩkua o hau hau na ndarĩire nyama.
Hyena felt his body break apart, kwa! He broke apart
and one side faced north.The other one faced south.
He died there and then and never ate the meat.
